# We name each VM (that isn't a template) as the FQDN of the VM.  This usually work well.
# This script lints for cases where there's a problem.  The aim is mostly:
# "does 'the name vCenter knows' match DNS match 'what VMware Tools says you are'?"
#
# It's prone to false nagatives / overreporting.  Problem spots:
# * Template without an FQDN
# * A decom'ed box that has been pulled from DNS
# * Template that's booted and thus has an unexpected name
# * HA pair'ed boxes that know their name as the floating-IP's name
# * VMware tools has crashed
